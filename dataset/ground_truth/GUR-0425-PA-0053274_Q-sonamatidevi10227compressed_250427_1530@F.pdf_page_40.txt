### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 11.8 gm% (slightly low for male, low-normal for female)
- Total Leucocyte Count: 11,900 /cu mm (mild leukocytosis)
- Polymorphs: 87% (elevated)
- Lymphocytes: 11% (decreased)
- RBC: 4.13 million/cmm (low)
- PCV (Packed Cell Volume): 33.8% (low)
- C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 12.1 mg/L (elevated, normal <6.0)
- Other parameters (MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelet Count, R.D.W, Blood Sugar) within normal limits

### Summary
The patient presents with mild anemia (low hemoglobin, RBC, and PCV), leukocytosis with neutrophilia (elevated polymorphs), and decreased lymphocytes, indicative of an acute inflammatory or infectious process. Elevated C-reactive protein further supports active inflammation. Blood sugar level is within normal range.

### Clinical Notes
- Mild anemia may be due to acute or chronic illness; further evaluation may be needed.
- Leukocytosis with neutrophilia and high CRP suggests an ongoing bacterial infection or inflammatory condition.
- The low lymphocyte percentage could be reactive or related to infection.
- Monitor clinical symptoms and consider further diagnostic workup including infection markers, cultures, or imaging if indicated.
- Evaluate for possible causes of anemia (nutritional, chronic disease, blood loss).
- Blood sugar is normal, minimizing concern for diabetes-related complications at this time.
