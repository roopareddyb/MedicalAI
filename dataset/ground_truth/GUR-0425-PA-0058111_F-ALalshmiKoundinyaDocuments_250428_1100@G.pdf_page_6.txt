### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL (within normal range 12 - 15)
- Packed Cell Volume (PCV): 37.2% (within normal range 36 - 46%)
- Total RBC Count: 4.20 million/cumm (within normal range 3.8 - 4.8)
- MCV: 88.5 fL (within normal range 83 - 101)
- MCH: 31.2 pg (within normal range 27 - 32)
- MCHC: 35.2 g/dL (slightly above normal range 31.5 - 34.5)
- RDW-CV: 12.6% (within normal range 11.6 - 14.0)
- Platelet Count: 1.72 Lakhs/cumm (within normal range 1.5 - 4.1 Lakhs)
- MPV: 8.9 fL (within normal range 7.0 - 10.0)
- Total WBC Count: 6980 cells/cumm (within normal range 4000 - 10000)
- Neutrophils: 65.7% (within normal range 40 - 80)
- Lymphocytes: 27.6% (within normal range 20 - 40)
- Eosinophils: 2.4% (within normal range 1 - 6)
- Monocytes: 3.3% (within normal range 2 - 10)
- Basophils: 1.0% (within normal range 0 - 2)

### Summary
The complete blood count (CBC) values are predominantly within their respective normal reference ranges. The only minor deviation is the MCHC which is slightly elevated at 35.2 g/dL, slightly exceeding the upper normal reference limit of 34.5 g/dL. This mild elevation is typically not significant but may warrant clinical correlation. All other parameters including hemoglobin, RBC indices, platelet count, and differential leukocyte counts are within normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
- The hemoglobin level and red cell indices indicate no anemia or polycythemia.
- The slight elevation in MCHC may suggest mild spherocytosis or other hemoglobin concentration abnormalities, but it is borderline and often clinically insignificant.
- Platelet count and MPV are normal, indicating no thrombocytopenia or platelet size anomalies.
- Total WBC and differential counts are unremarkable, with no evidence of infection, inflammation, or hematologic malignancy.
- Overall, the blood profile suggests normal hematologic function.
