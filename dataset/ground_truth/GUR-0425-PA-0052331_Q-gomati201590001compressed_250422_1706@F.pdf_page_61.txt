### Summary
The patient shows signs of mild anemia characterized by low hemoglobin, RBC count, PCV, and MCHC. The anemia appears normocytic normochromic given MCV and MCH within normal range. Total leukocyte count is slightly decreased with a relative lymphocytosis. Platelet count is at the lower limit of normal. Other white blood cell differentials fall within normal ranges.

### Clinical Notes
- The low hemoglobin and RBC indices suggest anemia, potentially of chronic disease or mild nutritional deficiency.
- Lymphocytosis with low total leukocyte count may suggest a viral infection or immune response.
- Mild thrombocytopenia or borderline platelet count may warrant monitoring.
- Further clinical correlation and possibly iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, and reticulocyte count may be useful to determine anemia cause.
- Consider evaluation for bone marrow function if clinically indicated.
