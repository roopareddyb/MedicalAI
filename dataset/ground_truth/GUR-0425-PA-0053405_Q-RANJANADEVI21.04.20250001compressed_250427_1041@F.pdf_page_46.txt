### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin (Hb): 11.2 gm/dl (slightly below the normal reference range of 11.5 - 16.5 gm/dl)
- Total Leucocyte Count (TLC): 16,800 /cumm (elevated; normal range 4,000 - 11,000 /cumm)
- Neutrophils: 77% (mildly elevated; normal range 40 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 20% (lower limit of normal; normal range 20 - 45%)
- Platelet Count: 0.82 Lakh/cmm (significantly low; normal range 1.50 - 4.50 Lakh/cmm)
- RBC Count: 3.90 Million/cmm (within normal range 3.8 - 4.8 Million/cmm)
- PCV/Hematocrit: 33.6% (slightly below normal range 35 - 45%)
- Other red cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC) are within normal limits.

### Summary
The laboratory results indicate mild anemia as evidenced by low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. There is leukocytosis driven by neutrophilia, which can suggest infection or inflammation. Thrombocytopenia is also present, with a platelet count well below the normal range. The red blood cell count and red cell indices are within normal limits except for a slightly reduced hematocrit.

### Clinical Notes
- The low hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest mild anemia. Further evaluation of anemia type and cause may be required.
- Elevated total leukocyte count with neutrophilia suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
- Low platelet count requires attention to rule out causes such as infection-related consumption, bone marrow suppression, or other hematologic conditions.
- Normal red cell indices suggest no gross abnormalities in red blood cell size or hemoglobin content.
- Clinical correlation with symptoms and further diagnostic workup including peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, and possible bone marrow examination might be warranted depending on clinical context.
