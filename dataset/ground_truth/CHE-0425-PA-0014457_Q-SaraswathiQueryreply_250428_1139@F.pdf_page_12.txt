### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Hemoglobin: 12.9 g/dL (within normal range)
- Hematocrit: 38.5% (within normal range)
- RBC count: 4.65 million/µL (within normal range)
- MCV: 82.8 fL (slightly below normal range of 83-101 fL)
- MCH: 27.7 pg (within normal range)
- MCHC: 33.5 g/dL (within normal range)
- RDW-CV: 15.9% (within normal range but at higher end)
- Total WBC count: 14.63 x10^3/µL (elevated; reference 4-11)
- Neutrophils: 83.6% (elevated; reference 40-75%)
- Lymphocytes: 11.4% (low; reference 20-40%)
- Absolute Neutrophil Count: 12.23 x10^3/µL (elevated; reference 2-7)
- Absolute Lymphocyte Count: 1.67 x10^3/µL (normal)
- Monocytes and other differentials within normal limits except eosinophils which are 0 (below reference)
- Platelet count: 212 x10^3/µL (normal)

### Summary
The complete blood count demonstrates a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit with a mild reduction in MCV suggesting normocytic to slightly microcytic red cells. There is significant leukocytosis primarily due to neutrophilia with an absolute neutrophil count almost double the upper limit of normal. Lymphocyte percentage is decreased, although the absolute lymphocyte count remains normal. Other cell lines including monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets are within or slightly below normal limits. The findings suggest an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory response given the neutrophilia.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated WBC with predominant neutrophilia is most likely indicative of acute infection or inflammation.
- Slightly low MCV may warrant monitoring to evaluate for developing anemia or iron status, although hemoglobin is currently normal.
- The absence of eosinophils may be reactive; clinical correlation needed for allergies or parasitic infections.
- Platelets are stable, indicating no current thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis.
- Recommend clinical correlation with patient symptoms, possible infection source, and further workup if clinically indicated.
