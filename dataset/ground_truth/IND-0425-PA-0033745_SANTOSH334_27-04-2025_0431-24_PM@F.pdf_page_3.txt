### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c): 6.6% (Diabetes diagnosis threshold ≥ 6.5%)
- Mean Plasma Glucose: 142.7 mg/dL (Above reference range <116.0 mg/dL)
- Hepatitis B Core Antibodies (Total): Non-reactive (0.150 S/CO, reference <1.00 non-reactive)
- Hepatitis B Surface Antigen: Non-reactive (0.39 COI, reference <1.00 non-reactive)
- Hepatitis C Antibodies: Non-reactive (0.05 COI, reference <0.9 non-reactive)
- HIV 4th Gen Assay (P24Ag + HIV Ab): Non-reactive

### Summary
The patient’s HbA1c is 6.6%, which meets the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus (≥6.5%) according to ADA guidelines. The mean plasma glucose is elevated, supporting hyperglycemia. Viral serologies for Hepatitis B (core antibodies and surface antigen), Hepatitis C, and HIV are all non-reactive, indicating no current infection with these viruses.

### Clinical Notes
- The HbA1c level suggests established diabetes; glycemic control should be evaluated and treatment optimized as needed.
- Mean plasma glucose confirms elevated glucose levels consistent with the HbA1c.
- The patient shows no serological evidence of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV infections.
- Monitoring and management should focus on diabetes care, including lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacotherapy.
- Further assessment may include evaluating for diabetes complications and cardiovascular risk factors.
