### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Urine analysis:
  - Volume: 10 ml
  - Colour: Pale Yellow
  - Appearance: Clear
  - pH: 6.0
  - Specific Gravity: 1.015
  - Protein: Negative
  - Reducing Sugar: Negative
  - Pus Cells: 2-3 (slightly elevated, normal <5)
  - Epithelial Cells: 0-1 (normal)
  - Casts: Nil
  - Crystals: Nil
- Coagulation profile:

  - Prothrombin Control: 12.5 sec
  - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT): 31.2 sec (within normal range 27.8 - 37.2 sec)
- Hematology:

  - Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): 30.9 pg (normal)
  - Packed Cell Volume (PCV): 34.2% (slightly low, normal 37 - 47%)

### Summary
The urine analysis reveals no significant abnormalities with only a mild presence of pus cells suggesting minimal inflammation or possible early infection. Coagulation parameters are within normal limits, indicating normal blood clotting function. The hematology results show mild anemia characterized by low hemoglobin, RBC count, and packed cell volume; however, red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC) are within normal limits, suggesting normocytic normochromic anemia. The lymphocyte percentage is mildly decreased, which may reflect a transient immunological change. Other white blood cell differentials are normal.

### Clinical Notes
- Mild anemia detected; further evaluation may be needed to identify underlying cause (e.g., nutritional deficiency, chronic disease).
- Slightly decreased lymphocyte percentage might warrant monitoring if clinically indicated.
- Urine findings are largely normal, with minimal pus cells; clinical correlation is advised to rule out early urinary tract infection.
- Coagulation profile is normal, suggesting no bleeding risk at present.
- Overall, the findings suggest mild hematologic abnormality without active infection or coagulopathy.
