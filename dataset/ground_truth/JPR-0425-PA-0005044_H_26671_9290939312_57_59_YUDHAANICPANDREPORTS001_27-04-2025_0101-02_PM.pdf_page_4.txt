### Extracted Table
Test Name Result Unit Reference Range
Erythrocytes Sedimentation Rate ESR 03 mm/1hr 0 - 10

### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is 3 mm/hr, which is within the normal reference range of 0-10 mm/hr.

### Summary
- The ESR value is normal, indicating no current significant inflammation or infection detectable by this test.

### Clinical Notes
- ESR is a nonspecific marker that may be elevated in inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic conditions. A normal value suggests the absence of acute or chronic inflammatory processes at the time of testing.
- Correlation with clinical findings and other laboratory tests is necessary for comprehensive evaluation.
