### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 11.5 g/dl (Low, normal range not specified but generally ~13.5-17.5 g/dl for males)
- RBC Count: 4.3 million/cmm (Low; reference: 4.5 - 6.5 million/cmm)
- PCV (Packed Cell Volume): 35.8% (Low; reference: 36 - 52%)
- MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 26.6 pg (Low; reference: 27.0 - 32.0 pg)
- Total WBC Count: 17,100 /cmm (High; reference: 4,000 - 10,000 /cmm)
- Neutrophils: 78% (High; reference: 40 - 70%)
- Blood Sugar Random: 93 mg/dl (Normal; reference: 80 - 150 mg/dl)
- Platelet Count: 197,000 /cmm (Normal; reference: 150,000 - 450,000 /cmm)
- Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride): Within normal limits
- Calcium Ionized: 4.62 mg/dL (Normal; reference: 4.6 - 5.3 mg/dL)
- Blood Urea: 37 mg/dl (Normal; reference: 10 - 40 mg/dl)

### Summary
The patient shows mild anemia indicated by low haemoglobin, RBC count, PCV, and MCH values. There is an elevated total white blood cell count and increased neutrophils suggestive of an acute inflammatory or infectious process. Blood sugar and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Platelet count is normal. Other blood indices such as MCV, MCHC, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes are within or at normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
- The low haemoglobin and red cell indices point toward a mild anemia, which may require further evaluation of iron status or other causes.
- The leukocytosis with neutrophilia may indicate an ongoing bacterial infection or inflammation.
- Normal blood sugar and electrolytes suggest stable metabolic status.
- Clinical correlation is advised to evaluate symptoms and possible sources of infection or inflammation.
- Follow-up and further hematological evaluation may be warranted.
