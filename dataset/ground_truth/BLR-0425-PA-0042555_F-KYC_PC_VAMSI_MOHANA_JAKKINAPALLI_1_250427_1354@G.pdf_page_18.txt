  - Differential WBC: neutrophils 55.1%, lymphocytes 36.9%, monocytes 5.6%, eosinophils 1.8%, basophils 0.6% (all within reference ranges)
- Renal function:
  - Serum creatinine: 0.84 mg/dl (normal)
  - Estimated GFR: 105.7 ml/min/1.73m² (excellent renal function)

### Summary
The laboratory results reveal a normal urine analysis with slightly turbid urine and the presence of hyaline casts, which can be a normal finding. The hematological parameters are largely within normal limits, except for a slightly low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and a slightly elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which are minimally outside reference ranges but not likely clinically significant in isolation. The kidney function tests are normal, with a good glomerular filtration rate.

### Clinical Notes
- The slightly turbid urine may reflect mild concentration changes or presence of hyaline casts but is not indicative of infection or pathology, given normal WBC and RBC in urine.
- MCV slightly below normal with normal hemoglobin and RBC count suggests no significant anemia; may warrant routine monitoring depending on clinical context.
- Elevated MCHC can occur due to various benign reasons; correlation with clinical findings advised.
- Good renal function demonstrated by normal creatinine and high eGFR.
- Overall, these results are consistent with normal renal and hematologic status.
