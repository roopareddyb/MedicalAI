### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Total Bilirubin: 0.601 mg/dL (within normal limits)
- Direct Bilirubin: 0.409 mg/dL (slightly above normal upper limit of 0.40 mg/dL)
- Indirect Bilirubin: 0.19 mg/dL (normal)
- S.G.O.T (AST): 70 U/L (elevated; normal range 14-36)
- S.G.P.T (ALT): 32 U/L (normal)
- G.G.T: 61 U/L (elevated; normal range 12-43)
- Alkaline Phosphatase: 126 U/L (upper limit of normal)
- Total Proteins: 7.7 gm/dL (normal)
- Albumin: 4.1 gm/dL (normal)
- Globulin: 3.6 gm/dL (slightly elevated; normal 2.5-3.5)
- A/G Ratio: 1.14 (decreased; normal 1.5-2.5)
- Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL (low; anemia)
- Packed Cell Volume (PCV): 33.6% (low)
- RBC Count: 3.33 x10^12/L (low)
- MCV: 100.9 fL (upper normal limit, indicating macrocytosis or borderline)
- MCH: 30.9 pg (normal)

### Summary
The patient exhibits liver function abnormalities including elevated AST and GGT, with a borderline high direct bilirubin. The alkaline phosphatase is at the upper limit of normal. The low A/G ratio is likely due to a slightly raised globulin level. The complete blood count suggests mild anemia with reduced hemoglobin, PCV, and RBC count; the MCV is at the higher end of normal, suggesting a possible macrocytic or borderline red cell picture.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated AST and GGT indicate possible hepatocellular injury or cholestasis.
- Mild hyperbilirubinemia limited to direct bilirubin suggests possible cholestatic or hepatic dysfunction.
- The low A/G ratio may reflect chronic inflammation or liver dysfunction affecting globulin and albumin synthesis.
- Anemia is present with mild macrocytosis, which could be due to nutritional deficiencies (e.g., B12 or folate), liver disease, or other causes; further evaluation is recommended.
- Correlation with clinical history, physical examination, and possibly additional tests (e.g., viral hepatitis serology, iron studies, vitamin levels) is advised.
