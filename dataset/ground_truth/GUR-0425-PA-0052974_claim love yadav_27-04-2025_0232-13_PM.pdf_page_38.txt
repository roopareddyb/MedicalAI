### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 9.9 gm/dL (Low; reference 11.5 - 15.5)
- Packed Cell Volume (PCV/Hematocrit): 29.9% (Low; reference 40 - 50)
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): 72.4 fl (Low; reference 77 - 95)
- Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): 23.2 pg (Low; reference 27 - 31)
- Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): 32.1% (Slightly low; reference 33 - 37)
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): 15.7 (High; reference 11.5 - 14.5)
- Neutrophils: 68% (Slightly elevated; reference 45 - 65)
- Lymphocytes: 24% (Low; reference 35 - 45)
- Other parameters including TLC, RBC count, platelet count, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils are within normal limits.

### Summary
The patient has anemia characterized by low hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and MCHC, suggestive of a microcytic hypochromic anemia pattern. Elevated RDW suggests significant variation in red blood cell size. Mild neutrophilia and relative lymphopenia may indicate a response to inflammation or infection. Platelet count is normal.

### Clinical Notes
- The microcytic hypochromic anemia pattern often suggests iron deficiency anemia or chronic disease anemia; further evaluation with iron studies, ferritin, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis may be warranted.
- Elevated RDW supports a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia or mixed anemia.
- Neutrophil predominance could reflect an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process.
- Clinical correlation is essential to determine underlying causes and guide management.
- Monitoring and possibly treating anemia may be required depending on clinical assessment.
