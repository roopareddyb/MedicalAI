### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin (Hb): 12.6 gm/dl (within normal range)
- Total Leucocyte Count (TLC): 20,600 /cumm (elevated; normal 4,000 - 11,000)
- Neutrophils: 79% (slightly elevated; normal 40 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 15% (low; normal 20 - 45%)
- Eosinophils: 3% (normal)
- Monocytes: 3% (normal)
- Basophils: 0% (normal)
- Platelet Count: 2.10 Lakh/cmm (normal)
- RBC Count: 4.45 million/cmm (normal)
- Packed Cell Volume (PCV)/Hematocrit: 37.8% (normal)
- MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): 84.94 fl (normal)
- MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 28.31 pg (normal)
- MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): 33.3 gm/dl (normal)
- Urine Routine Microscopy (RM): Not available

### Summary
The complete blood count reveals leukocytosis with a significantly elevated total leukocyte count and neutrophilia, accompanied by relative lymphopenia. The haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell indices, and platelet count are within normal reference ranges. The findings suggest an ongoing acute bacterial infection or inflammatory response. Urine routine microscopy was not performed or data is unavailable.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated TLC and neutrophilia commonly indicate bacterial infection or acute inflammatory conditions.
- Relative lymphopenia can be seen in stress situations or infections.
- Normal hemoglobin and RBC indices indicate no anemia.
- Platelet count is normal, indicating no platelet production issues or consumption.
- Correlation with clinical symptoms and further investigations (such as cultures or imaging) are advised for definitive diagnosis.
- Urine analysis is missing; if clinical suspicion exists (e.g., UTI), urine testing should be performed.
