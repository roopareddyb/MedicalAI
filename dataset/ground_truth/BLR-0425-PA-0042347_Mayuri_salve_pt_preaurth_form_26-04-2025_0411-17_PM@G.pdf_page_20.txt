### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dl (within normal range)
- Total WBC Count: 10,900 /µl (upper normal limit)
- Neutrophils: 55% (normal)
- Lymphocytes: 40% (upper normal limit)
- Eosinophils: 2% (normal)
- Monocytes: 3% (normal)
- Basophils: 0% (normal)
- Hematocrit: 38.6% (normal)
- RBC Count: 4.23 million/cmm (slightly low)
- MCV: 91.25 fL (normal)
- MCH: 29.79 pg (normal)
- MCHC: 32.64 g/dl (normal)
- RDW-CV: 12.6% (normal)
- RDW-SD: 46.5 fL (normal)
- Platelet Count: 361,000 /cmm (normal)
- MPV: 9.1 fL (normal)
- PDW: 14.9 fL (normal)
- PCT: 0.33% (normal)

### Summary
The complete blood count shows overall normal values except for a slightly decreased red blood cell count and borderline total white blood cell count at the high end of the reference range. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal limits, indicating no significant anemia. Platelet parameters are also normal. Differential counts are balanced with no apparent leukocytosis or eosinophilia.

### Clinical Notes
- The mild reduction in RBC count warrants clinical correlation but hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
- The total WBC count is at the upper limit of normal, possibly indicating a reactive or inflammatory state if clinically relevant.
- Differential percentages are within normal ranges, suggesting no active infection or hematologic disorder.
- Continue routine monitoring as indicated by clinical context.
