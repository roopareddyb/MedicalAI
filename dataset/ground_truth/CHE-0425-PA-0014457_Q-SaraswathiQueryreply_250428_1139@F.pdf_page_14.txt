### Summary
The complete blood count shows leukocytosis with a marked increase in total WBC count, predominantly neutrophilia and monocytosis. Lymphocyte percentage is mildly decreased but the absolute lymphocyte count is slightly elevated, indicating a relative shift in white cell populations. Eosinophils are absent, both in percentage and absolute count. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC indices, and platelets are within normal limits, though MCV is at the lower limit. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is substantially elevated, indicating an active inflammatory or infectious process.

### Clinical Notes
- The elevated WBC count with neutrophilia and monocytosis alongside a high ESR suggests an ongoing inflammatory, infectious, or possibly stress response.
- Absence of eosinophils could be due to acute infection or corticosteroid effect.
- Red cell parameters are stable, with no evidence of anemia or significant red cell morphology abnormalities.
- Close clinical correlation is advised to evaluate for infection, inflammation, or other causes (e.g., autoimmune, hematologic disorders).
- If clinically indicated, further investigations such as blood cultures, inflammatory markers, or imaging may be warranted.
