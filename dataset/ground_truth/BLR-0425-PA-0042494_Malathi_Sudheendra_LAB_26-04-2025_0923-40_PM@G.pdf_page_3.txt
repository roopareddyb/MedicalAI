### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- RBC Count: 4.14 mil/cmm (normal)
- Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL (low normal)
- Platelet Count: 129 K/uL (low; reference 150-400 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 3.9 mg/dL (significantly elevated; reference 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- Bicarbonate: 18.6 mmol/L (low; reference 22-29 mmol/L)
- Electrolytes: Sodium 138 mmol/L (normal), Potassium 5.0 mmol/L (upper normal), Chloride 103.5 mmol/L (normal)

Other hematology parameters (WBC, differential counts, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW) are within reference ranges, except PCV at 36.3% is at the low limit.

### Summary
- The patient shows a normal red blood cell count and hemoglobin slightly at low normal.
- Platelet count is decreased, suggesting mild thrombocytopenia.
- Kidney function marker creatinine is markedly elevated, indicating possible renal impairment.
- Low bicarbonate level may suggest metabolic acidosis or compensatory changes.
- Electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, potassium at high normal, which may need monitoring given kidney status.
- White blood cell counts and differentials are within normal limits, no signs of infection or hematological abnormalities.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated creatinine indicates impaired renal function; investigation into the cause of acute or chronic kidney injury is warranted.
- Low bicarbonate supports possible metabolic acidosis, common in kidney dysfunction.
- Mild thrombocytopenia requires monitoring; could be related to renal disease or other causes.
- Normal hemoglobin and RBC count suggest no anemia or marrow suppression at this time.
- Monitor potassium closely due to kidney impairment, as risk of hyperkalemia is elevated.
- Overall, labs suggest moderate kidney dysfunction with secondary metabolic disturbances.
