### Summary
The patient has mild anemia evidenced by low hemoglobin, MCH, and MCHC, though hematocrit and RBC count are within normal limits. The red cell indices suggest hypochromic normocytic anemia. There is leukocytosis with elevated total WBC count driven mainly by increased absolute neutrophils and eosinophils. Platelet count is also elevated (thrombocytosis). These findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process, allergic or parasitic reaction (considering high eosinophils), or other causes of reactive leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.

### Clinical Notes
- Low hemoglobin with low MCH and MCHC could indicate early iron deficiency or chronic disease anemia.
- Elevated total WBC with neutrophilia and eosinophilia may be due to bacterial infection, allergic response, or parasitic infestation.
- Thrombocytosis is often reactive, secondary to inflammation or infection.
- Clinical correlation including patient symptoms, history, and additional tests (iron studies, inflammatory markers, infection workup) is recommended.
