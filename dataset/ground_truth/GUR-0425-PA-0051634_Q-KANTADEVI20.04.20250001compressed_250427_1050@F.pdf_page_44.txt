### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 12.7 gm/dl (within reference range 11.5 - 16.5)
- Total Leucocyte Count (TLC): 17,200 /cumm (elevated; normal 4000 - 11000)
- Neutrophils: 73% (upper normal limit 40 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 22% (normal 20 - 45%)
- Eosinophils: 2% (normal 1 - 6%)
- Monocytes: 3% (normal 2 - 10%)
- Basophils: 0% (normal 0%)
- Platelet Count: 2.31 Lakh/cmm (normal 1.50 - 4.50 Lakh/cmm)
- RBC Count: 3.95 Millions/cmm (normal 3.8 - 4.8)
- PCV / Hematocrit: 38.1% (normal 35 - 45%)
- MCV: 96.46 fl (normal 80 - 100)
- MCH: 32.15 pg (slightly elevated; normal 27.0 - 31.0)
- MCHC: 33.3 gm/dl (normal 30 - 35)

### Summary
The patient’s hemoglobin and red cell indices are mostly within normal ranges, with a slightly elevated Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH). Platelet count is normal. There is a significant leukocytosis (elevated total white blood cell count), predominantly neutrophilia, which could suggest an ongoing infection, inflammation, or other causes of increased neutrophils.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated TLC with neutrophilia may indicate an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory process.
- Other differential counts are within normal limits.
- Slightly increased MCH may be incidental or related to red blood cell changes; no significant anemia is noted given normal Hb and hematocrit.
- Platelets and RBC counts are normal, reducing concern for thrombocytopenia or anemia.
- Correlation with clinical presentation and possibly further investigations (e.g., differential diagnosis of infection/inflammation) is recommended.
