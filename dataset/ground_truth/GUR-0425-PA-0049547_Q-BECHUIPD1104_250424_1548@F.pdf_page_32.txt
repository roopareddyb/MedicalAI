### Summary
The patient presents with significant anemia as indicated by low hemoglobin, RBC count, and packed cell volume. The normal to slightly high MCV suggests a normocytic or borderline macrocytic anemia. Elevated total leucocyte count with neutrophilia (polymorphs 78%) and decreased lymphocytes indicate an ongoing acute infection or inflammatory process. The ESR is markedly elevated, supporting active inflammation. Platelet count is within normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
- Severe anemia requiring clinical correlation for symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and dyspnea.
- Leukocytosis with neutrophilia and raised ESR suggests possible bacterial infection or inflammation.
- The anemia is normocytic to slightly macrocytic; consider etiologies such as acute blood loss, chronic disease, or early megaloblastic anemia.
- Further investigations recommended: reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, peripheral smear examination, and infection work-up.
- Clinical correlation and treatment based on suspected underlying cause (infection treatment, anemia management) are advised.
