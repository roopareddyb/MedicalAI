- Neutrophils: 88% (elevated; reference 45 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 8% (decreased; reference 20 - 45%)
- ESR: 42 mm/hr (elevated; reference 0 - 15 mm/hr)
- CRP: 65.1 mg/dl (markedly elevated; reference < 6.0 mg/dl)
- Random Blood Sugar: 280 mg/dl (high; reference 70 - 140 mg/dl)
- Serum Bilirubin Total: 1.5 mg/dL (mildly elevated; reference 0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL)
- Serum Bilirubin Direct: 0.6 mg/dL (elevated; normal up to 0.2 mg/dL)
- Serum Bilirubin Indirect: 0.9 mg/dL (elevated; reference 0.2 - 0.6 mg/dL)

- Albumin: 2.2 g/dL (low; reference 3.2 - 5.0 g/dL)
- A:G Ratio: 0.85 (low; reference 1.5 - 2.5)
- MCHC: 31.49 g/dl (slightly low; reference 32 - 36)

### Summary
The lab results indicate anemia with low hemoglobin and low MCHC. There is significant leukocytosis mainly due to neutrophilia, suggesting an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory response. The marked elevation in CRP and ESR supports active inflammation. Blood glucose is high, consistent with hyperglycemia or poorly controlled diabetes. Mild hyperbilirubinemia with both direct and indirect fractions elevated suggests possible hepatic dysfunction or hemolysis. Low total proteins and albumin may reflect nutritional deficiency, chronic illness, or liver dysfunction. The decreased A:G ratio may indicate increased globulins relative to albumin, consistent with inflammation or liver disease.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated WBC with neutrophilia, high ESR and CRP strongly point toward an ongoing infection or significant inflammation.
- Hyperglycemia warrants evaluation for diabetes mellitus and consideration of diabetic control.
- Mild hyperbilirubinemia and low albumin suggest possible liver involvement; liver enzymes SGOT/SGPT were not available for interpretation.
- Anemia is present; further evaluation for cause (nutritional, chronic disease, or hemolysis) is advised.
- Low albumin and protein levels should prompt assessment for nutritional status and chronic illness.
- Follow-up with clinical correlation and additional testing (liver function tests, blood cultures, HbA1c) is recommended.
