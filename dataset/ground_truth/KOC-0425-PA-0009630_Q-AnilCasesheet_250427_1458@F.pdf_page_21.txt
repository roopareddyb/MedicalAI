### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin (Hb): 13.8 gm/dl (within normal range: 11.0 - 17.0)
- Total Count (WBC): 9920 cells/cumm (normal range: 4000 - 11000)
- Polymorphs: 77.6% (high-normal, upper end of normal 50 - 80%)
- Lymphocytes: 14.0% (low, below normal range 25 - 50%)
- Monocytes: 7.0% (normal range 2 - 10%)
- Eosinophils: 0.1% (normal, < 5%)
- Basophils: 0.3% (normal, < 2%)
- Platelet Count: 1.0 Lakhs/cumm (low, reference range 1.5 - 5.0 Lakhs/cumm)
- RBC: 4.11 million/cmm (normal range 3.8 - 6.5)
- PCV (Hematocrit): 39.9% (normal range 37.0 - 54.0)
- MCV: 97.1 fL (normal range 80 - 100)
- MCH: 33.6 pg (slightly elevated, normal range 27.0 - 32.0)

### Summary
- The hemoglobin level and RBC count are within normal limits.
- White blood cell total count is normal but shows a shift in differential count with decreased lymphocytes and elevated polymorphs, which may indicate an acute bacterial infection or inflammation.
- Platelet count is low (thrombocytopenia).
- Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is mildly elevated, possibly indicating macrocytic red cells or variation in cell hemoglobin content.
- Other parameters like PCV, MCV, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils are within normal ranges.

### Clinical Notes
- The low lymphocyte percentage combined with high polymorphs suggests a possible acute bacterial infection or stress response.
- Thrombocytopenia should be further evaluated for potential causes such as viral infections, bone marrow suppression, or platelet destruction.
- Slightly elevated MCH with normal MCV may require correlation with clinical context and further testing if anemia symptoms are present.
- Overall, the blood picture warrants clinical correlation and possibly further investigation depending on patient symptoms and history.
