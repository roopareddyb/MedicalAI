### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin (Hb): 10.8 gm/dl (Low; normal range 12.0 - 15.0)
- Total Leucocytic Count (TLC): 12,600 /cmm (Elevated; normal range 4,000 - 11,000)
- Neutrophils: 79% (Slightly elevated; normal range 40 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 18% (Low; normal range 20 - 40%)
- Platelet Count: 1.55 Lakh/cmm (Within normal low range; normal 1.50 - 4.10 Lakh/cmm)
- Packed Cell Volume (PCV/Hematocrit): 31.5% (Low; normal 35.0 - 46.0%)
- MCHC: 30.6 gm/dl (Slightly low; normal 31.0 - 37.0 gm/dl)
- RBC count, MCV, MCH are within normal limits.

### Summary
The patient exhibits mild anemia demonstrated by low haemoglobin, low hematocrit, and slightly reduced MCHC, suggesting a hypochromic, possibly normocytic anemia. There is leukocytosis with neutrophilia and relative lymphopenia, possibly indicating an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory process. Platelet count is within normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
- The mild anemia could be due to nutritional deficiency, chronic disease, or early blood loss; further workup may be warranted.
- Elevated TLC with neutrophilia and low lymphocytes suggests infection or inflammation.
- Correlation with clinical signs, symptoms, and possibly further investigations (e.g., iron studies, infection markers) is recommended.
