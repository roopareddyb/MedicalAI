### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Total WBC Count: Elevated at 13,900 /cumm (Reference: 4,000 - 10,500)
- Neutrophils: Elevated at 88% (Reference: 40 - 70%)
- Lymphocytes: Low at 10% (Reference: 20 - 45%)
- Monocytes: Low at 1% (Reference: 2 - 8%)
- Hemoglobin, RBC count, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, and Platelet Count are within normal reference ranges.

### Summary
The patient’s lab results show leukocytosis characterized by a high total white blood cell count and neutrophilia, with a concurrent decrease in lymphocytes and monocytes. Red blood cell parameters and platelet count are normal.

### Clinical Notes
- The elevated total WBC count and neutrophilia commonly suggest an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory process.
- Lymphopenia and monocytopenia may reflect redistribution or consumption in the inflammatory response.
- Normal hemoglobin and red cell indices indicate no anemia or red cell disorder currently.
- Platelet counts within normal range reduce the concern for thrombocytopenia.
- Correlation with clinical findings and possible further investigations for source of infection or inflammation is recommended.
