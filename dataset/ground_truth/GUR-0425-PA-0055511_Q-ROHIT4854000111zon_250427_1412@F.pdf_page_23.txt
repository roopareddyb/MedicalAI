### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Appearance: Yellowish (normal)
- pH: 7.5 (within reference range 5-8)
- Specific Gravity: 1.025 (within reference range 1.003-1.03)
- Urobilinogen: Nil (normal)
- Protein: Nil (normal)
- Blood: Nil (normal)
- Ketone: Nil (normal)
- Glucose: Nil (normal)
- RBC (per HPF): Nil (normal)
- WBC/Pus Cells (per HPF): 10-12 (elevated; reference range 0-4)
- Epithelial Cells (per HPF): 7-8 (elevated)
- Casts, Crystals, Amorphous, Other: Nil (normal)

### Summary
The urinalysis shows normal appearance, pH, specific gravity, and absence of protein, blood, glucose, ketones, and red blood cells. However, there is a significant increase in white blood cells (10-12 per HPF) and epithelial cells (7-8 per HPF), which may indicate an inflammatory or infectious process in the urinary tract. No casts, crystals, or other abnormalities were detected.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated WBCs in urine usually suggest urinary tract infection (UTI) or inflammation.
- Increased epithelial cells may indicate contamination or shedding from the urinary tract lining.
- Absence of RBCs suggests no gross hematuria.
- No proteinuria or glycosuria noted.
- Recommend clinical correlation for symptoms of UTI; consider urine culture and sensitivity testing.
- Further evaluation may be needed if symptoms persist or worsen.
