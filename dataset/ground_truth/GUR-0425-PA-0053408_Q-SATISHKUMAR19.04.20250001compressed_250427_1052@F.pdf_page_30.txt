### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Haemoglobin: 13.4 gm/dl (slightly below the reference range of 13.5 - 18.0)
- Total Leucocyte Count (TLC): 20,400 /cumm (markedly elevated; normal 4000 - 11000)
- Neutrophils: 77% (slightly above normal range 40 - 75%)
- Lymphocytes: 18% (slightly below normal range 20 - 45%)
- Eosinophils: 2% (within normal range 1 - 6%)
- Monocytes: 3% (within normal range 2 - 10%)
- Basophils: 0% (normal 0%)
- Platelet Count: 2.55 Lakh/cmm (within normal range 1.50 - 4.50)
- RBC Count: 4.34 Millions/cmm (slightly below normal 4.5 - 5.5)
- PCV/Hematocrit: 40.2% (normal lower range 40 - 54%)
- MCV: 92.63 fl (normal 80 - 100)
- MCH: 30.88 pg (normal 27.0 - 31.0)
- MCHC: 33.3 gm/dl (normal 30 - 35)

### Summary
The patient shows mild anemia indicated by slight decreases in hemoglobin and RBC count. There is a significant leukocytosis with a markedly elevated total leukocyte count, predominantly neutrophilia, suggesting an acute bacterial infection or inflammatory process. Other hematological indices including platelets, red cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC), and differential counts besides neutrophils and lymphocytes are within normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
- Elevated TLC with neutrophil predominance typically suggests bacterial infection or acute inflammation.
- Mild anemia could be anemia of chronic disease or related to the current illness.
- Lymphopenia may be reactive due to infection.
- Platelets and red cell indices are preserved.
- Further clinical correlation and possibly infection workup (cultures, imaging) is advised.
- Repeat CBC after treatment to monitor response.
