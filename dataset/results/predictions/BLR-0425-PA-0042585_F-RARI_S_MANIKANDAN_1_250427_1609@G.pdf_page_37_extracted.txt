### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Elevated CRP: 14.5 mg/L (Reference Range: 0-5 mg/L).
- RDW at upper limit of reference range: 13.7% (Reference Range: 11.60-13.70%).

### Summary
The report indicates an elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level of 14.5 mg/L, which is above the reference range of 0-5 mg/L. Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is at the upper limit of its reference range at 13.7%. Platelet Count (299 thousand/cu.mm), Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) (9.2 fL), and Glucose Random (99 mg/dL) are all within their respective reference ranges. Beta HCG is <0.2 mIU/ml, consistent with a non-pregnant state.

### Clinical Notes
- RDW (sheath flow DC detection) result is 13.7%, which is at the upper limit of the reference range (11.60-13.70%).
- Platelet Count (sheath flow DC detection/ Optical) result is 299 thousand/cu.mm, which is within the reference range (150-400 thousand/cu.mm).
- MPV (sheath flow DC detection) result is 9.2 fL, which is within the reference range (7.80-11 fL).
- Glucose Random (Hexokinase method) result is 99 mg/dL, which is within the normal range (70 -140 mg/dL).
- Beta HCG (ECLIA) result is <0.2 mIU/ml, which is within the non-pregnant reference range (0.1-5.7 mIU/ml).
- CRP (Immunoturbidimetric method) result is 14.5 mg/L, which is elevated above the reference range (0-5 mg/L).
