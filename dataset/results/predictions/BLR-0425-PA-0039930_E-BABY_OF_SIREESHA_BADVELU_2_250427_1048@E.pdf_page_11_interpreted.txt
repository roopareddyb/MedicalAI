### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- RDW is 16.0%, which is above the reference range of 11.6-14.0%.
- Neutrophils are 58%, which is above the reference range of 20-45%.
- Lymphocytes are 26%, which is below the reference range of 28-35%.
- Eosinophils are 07%, which is above the reference range of 1.4-4.3%.
- Monocytes are 09%, which is above the reference range of 4-7%.

### Summary
The extracted table indicates several parameters outside their reference ranges: RDW, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, and Monocytes are elevated, while Lymphocytes are decreased. Platelet count, Mean Cell Volume (MCV), Mean Cell Haemoglobin (MCH), Mean Cell Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and Basophils are within their respective reference ranges.
