### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- HAEMOGLOBIN: 11.8 g/dL (Reference: 13.5 to 18.0 g/dL) - Low
- TOTAL ERYTHROCYTE (RBC) COUNT: 4.02 X 10^6/uL (Reference: 4.2 to 5.6 X 10^6/uL) - Low
- PACKED CELLS VOLUME: 33.5 % (Reference: 42 to 52 %) - Low

### Summary
The patient's HAEMOGLOBIN, TOTAL ERYTHROCYTE (RBC) COUNT, and PACKED CELLS VOLUME are below their respective reference ranges. All other measured parameters with provided reference ranges (MCV, MCH, MCHC, TOTAL WBC COUNT, NEUTROPHILS, BASOPHILS, PLATELET COUNT, and RDW) are within their normal limits. Reference ranges were not available for LYMPHOCYTES, EOSINOPHILS, and MONOCYTES.

### Clinical Notes
The observed low HAEMOGLOBIN, TOTAL ERYTHROCYTE (RBC) COUNT, and PACKED CELLS VOLUME indicate a reduction in the red blood cell mass. The MCV, MCH, MCHC, and RDW are within normal limits, suggesting that the existing red blood cells are normocytic, normochromic, and uniform in size.
