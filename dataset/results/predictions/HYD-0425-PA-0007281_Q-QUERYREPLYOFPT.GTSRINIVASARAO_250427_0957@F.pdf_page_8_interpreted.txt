### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- PCV is elevated at 48.0% (Reference Range: 36-46%).
- TOTAL RBC COUNT is elevated at 5.3 cells/cumm (Reference Range: 3.8-4.8 cells/cumm).
- An unnamed test shows a result of 16.0 g/dL. This value is above the reference range for females (11.5-15.0 g/dL) but within the reference range for males (13.5-18.0 g/dL).

### Summary
The report indicates elevated PCV and Total RBC Count. An unnamed test result is 16.0 g/dL, which is high for females but within the normal range for males. All other measured parameters, including Platelet Count (2.5 Lakhs/cumm), Total WBC Count (9,000 cells/cumm), Polymorphs (57%), Lymphocytes (35%), Eosinophils (03%), Monocytes (05%), and Basophils (00%), are within their respective reference ranges. RBC morphology is described as NORMOCYTIC/NORMOCHROMIC, and platelets are noted as ADEQUATE. WBCs are reported as WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.
