### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is 6.6%, which is above the non-diabetic adult reference range of < 5.7%.
- Mean Plasma Glucose is 142.7 mg/dL, which is above the reference range of <116.0 mg/dL.
- Hepatitis B Core Antibodies (Total) are NON REACTIVE (0.150 S/CO), within the non-reactive range of <1.00 S/CO.
- Hepatitis B Surface Antigen is 0.39 COI, within the non-reactive range of <1.00 COI.
- Hepatitis C Antibodies are NON REACTIVE (0.05 COI), within the non-reactive range of <0.9 COI.
- HIV 4th Gen Assay (P24AG + HIV AB) is NON REACTIVE.

### Summary
The patient exhibits elevated Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) and Mean Plasma Glucose levels, indicating impaired glucose regulation. Serological tests for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV are non-reactive.

### Clinical Notes
The Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) result of 6.6% exceeds the non-diabetic adult reference range of < 5.7%, suggesting a potential diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes. This finding is supported by the elevated Mean Plasma Glucose of 142.7 mg/dL, which is above the reference range of <116.0 mg/dL. All tested markers for Hepatitis B (Core Antibodies Total and Surface Antigen), Hepatitis C (Antibodies), and HIV (4th Gen Assay) are non-reactive, consistent with the respective reference ranges for non-reactive status.
