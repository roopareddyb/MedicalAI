### Key Findings
- HAEMOGLOBIN (Hb) is low at 13.1 gm/dL (Reference Range: 13.5-18.0).
- TOTAL LEUCOCYTE COUNT (TLC) is high at 16,700 /cumm (Reference Range: 4000-11000).
- NEUTROPHIL percentage is high at 84 % (Reference Range: 40-75).
- LYMPHOCYTE percentage is low at 14 % (Reference Range: 20-45).
- MONOCYTE percentage is low at 01 % (Reference Range: 02-10).
- PC.V/HAEMATOCRIT is low at 39.3 % (Reference Range: 40-54).
- EOSINOPHIL is 01 % (Reference Range: 01-06), BASOPHIL is 00 % (Reference Range: 0-0), PLATELET COUNT is 2.69 Lakh/cmm (Reference Range: 1.50-4.50), RBC COUNT is 4.53 Millions/cmm (Reference Range: 4.5-5.5), MCV is 86.75 fl. (Reference Range: 80-100), MCH is 28.92 Picogram (Reference Range: 27.0-31.0), and MCHC is 33.3 gm/dL (Reference Range: 30-35), all of which are within their respective reference ranges.

### Summary
The complete blood count indicates several abnormalities. There is evidence of mild anemia, characterized by low Haemoglobin (13.1 gm/dL) and PC.V/Haematocrit (39.3 %). The white blood cell count is elevated (16,700 /cumm), primarily driven by a significant increase in Neutrophils (84 %). Conversely, Lymphocytes (14 %) and Monocytes (01 %) are decreased. Other parameters, including Platelet Count, RBC Count, and red cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC), are within normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
The observed laboratory findings suggest a pattern of leukocytosis with neutrophilia, accompanied by lymphopenia and monocytopenia. Additionally, there is a mild reduction in red blood cell parameters (Haemoglobin and PC.V/Haematocrit). These results should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, and other diagnostic findings.
