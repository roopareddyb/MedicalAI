### Key Findings
-   **TOTAL LEUCOCYTE COUNT:** Elevated at 16700 cells/cmm (Reference Range: 4000-11000 cells/cmm).
-   **NEUTROPHILS:** Elevated at 79.3% (Reference Range: 50-70%).
-   **LYMPHOCYTES:** Low at 11.6% (Reference Range: 20-40%).
-   **PLATELET COUNT:** Elevated at 4.78 Lakhs/Cumm (Reference Range: 1.50-4 Lakhs/Cumm).
-   **HAEMOGLOBIN:** Result is 10.000 g%, but no reference range is provided for interpretation.
-   **EOSINOPHILS:** Within reference range at 1.3% (Reference Range: 01-06%).
-   **MONOCYTES:** Within reference range at 7.3% (Reference Range: 2-10%).
-   **BASOPHILS:** Within reference range at 0.5% (Reference Range: 0-1%).

### Summary
The laboratory report indicates an elevated total leucocyte count, primarily due to an increase in neutrophils, accompanied by a decrease in lymphocytes. The platelet count is also elevated. The haemoglobin value is noted, but its clinical significance cannot be assessed without a reference range. Eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils are within their respective normal limits.

### Clinical Notes
No clinical notes can be derived solely from the provided laboratory table. Interpretation of these findings requires correlation with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and other diagnostic tests.
