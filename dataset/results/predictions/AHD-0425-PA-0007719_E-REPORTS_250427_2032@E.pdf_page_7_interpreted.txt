### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- **Haemoglobin:** 9.10 g/dL (Reference Range: 13.0-17.0 g/dL) - Low
- **Total R.B.C. Count:** 3.19 mill/cmm (Reference Range: 4.5-5.5 mill/cmm) - Low
- **Haematocrit (PCV/HCT):** 27.20 % (Reference Range: 40.0-50.0%) - Low
- **Red cell Distribution Width (R.D.W.-CV):** 16.5 % (Reference Range: 11.6-14.6%) - High
- **Total W.B.C. Count:** 10560 /uL (Reference Range: 4000-10000 /uL) - High
- **Neutrophils:** 87.7 % (Reference Range: 40-70%) - High
- **Lymphocytes:** 5.9 % (Reference Range: 20-40%) - Low
- **Eosinophils:** 0.7 % (Reference Range: 1-6%) - Low
- **Neutrophils (abs):** 9261.12 /uL (Reference Range: 1575-6800 /uL) - High
- **Lymphocytes (abs):** 623.04 /uL (Reference Range: 1125-4950 /uL) - Low

### Summary
The report indicates several values outside their respective reference ranges. Red blood cell parameters including Haemoglobin (9.10 g/dL), Total R.B.C. Count (3.19 mill/cmm), and Haematocrit (27.20 %) are below the lower limit of their reference ranges. The Red cell Distribution Width (R.D.W.-CV) is elevated at 16.5 %. The Total W.B.C. Count is high at 10560 /uL. This is primarily driven by an elevated Neutrophil percentage (87.7 %) and absolute count (9261.12 /uL). Conversely, Lymphocyte percentage (5.9 %) and absolute count (623.04 /uL), and Eosinophil percentage (0.7 %) are below their respective reference ranges. All other measured parameters are within their specified reference ranges.

### Clinical Notes
Based solely on the provided table, the following observations are noted:
- Red blood cell indices show decreased Haemoglobin, Total R.B.C. Count, and Haematocrit.
- Red cell Distribution Width (R.D.W.-CV) is increased.
- White blood cell count is elevated, with an increase in Neutrophils (both percentage and absolute count).
- There is a decrease in Lymphocytes (both percentage and absolute count) and Eosinophils (percentage).
No further clinical interpretation or diagnostic statements are provided as per instructions to use only the extracted table and not invent values.
