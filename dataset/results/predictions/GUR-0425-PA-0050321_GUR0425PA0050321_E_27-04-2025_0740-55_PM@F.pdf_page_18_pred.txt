### Key Findings
- **Anemia**: Haemoglobin (7.6 g/dL), Packed Cell Volume (24.1%), and RBC Count (2.71 10-12/L) are below their respective reference ranges.
- **Leukocytosis**: Total Leucocyte Count (TLC) is elevated at 17.0 10-9/L.
- **Neutrophilia**: Neutrophils (94.3%) and Absolute Neutrophil Count (16.03 10-9/L) are above their reference ranges.
- **Lymphopenia**: Lymphocytes (1.2%) and Absolute Lymphocyte Count (0.2 10-9/L) are below their reference ranges.
- **Eosinopenia**: Eosinophils are absent (0.0%).
- **Elevated RDW**: Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is high at 15.1%.
- Other parameters including MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelet Count, MPV, Monocytes, Basophils, Absolute Monocyte Count, and Absolute Basophil Count are within their respective reference ranges.

### Summary
The complete blood count results indicate significant abnormalities. There is evidence of anemia, characterized by low Haemoglobin (7.6 g/dL), Packed Cell Volume (24.1%), and RBC Count (2.71 10-12/L). The Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is elevated at 15.1%, while MCV, MCH, and MCHC are within normal limits.

The white blood cell differential shows leukocytosis (Total Leucocyte Count of 17.0 10-9/L), primarily due to a marked neutrophilia (94.3% and Absolute Neutrophil Count of 16.03 10-9/L). Concurrently, there is lymphopenia (1.2% and Absolute Lymphocyte Count of 0.2 10-9/L) and eosinopenia (0.0%). Monocytes and Basophils are within their normal ranges. The Platelet Count is normal at 247 10-9/L.

### Clinical Notes
The findings suggest a significant inflammatory or infectious process given the leukocytosis with neutrophilia and concurrent lymphopenia and eosinopenia. The anemia, with an elevated RDW, warrants further investigation to determine its etiology.
