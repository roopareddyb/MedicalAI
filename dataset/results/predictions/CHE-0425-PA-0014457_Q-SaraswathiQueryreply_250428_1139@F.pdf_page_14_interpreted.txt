### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Total WBC Count is elevated at 17.53 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 4-11).
- Lymphocyte percentage is low at 18.3% (Reference Range: 20-40).
- Monocyte percentage is elevated at 12.2% (Reference Range: 2-10).
- Eosinophil percentage is low at 0.0% (Reference Range: 1-6).
- Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is elevated at 12.15 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 2-7).
- Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) is elevated at 3.21 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 1-3).
- Absolute Monocyte Count (AMC) is elevated at 2.14 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 0.2-1).
- Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) is low at 0.00 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 0.02-0.5).
- Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is elevated at 55 mm/1hr (Reference Range: 0-30).

### Summary
The complete blood count indicates leukocytosis, characterized by an elevated total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, and absolute monocyte count. Concurrently, there is a relative lymphopenia and eosinopenia, with low absolute eosinophil count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is significantly elevated. All red blood cell parameters and platelet count are within their respective reference ranges.

### Clinical Notes
Based solely on the provided laboratory results:
- **Inflammatory Markers:** Elevated Total WBC Count (17.53 10^3/uL) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (55 mm/1hr).
- **White Blood Cell Differential:**
    - Neutrophilia (Absolute Neutrophil Count: 12.15 10^3/uL).
    - Absolute Lymphocytosis (Absolute Lymphocyte Count: 3.21 10^3/uL) with relative Lymphopenia (Lymphocyte %: 18.3%).
    - Monocytosis (Monocyte %: 12.2%, Absolute Monocyte Count: 2.14 10^3/uL).
    - Eosinopenia (Eosinophil %: 0.0%, Absolute Eosinophil Count: 0.00 10^3/uL).
- **Red Blood Cell Parameters:** All values (Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, Total RBC Count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV) are within normal limits.
- **Platelet Count:** Within normal limits (224 10^3/uL).
