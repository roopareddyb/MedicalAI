### Interpretation
### Key Findings
-   **TOTAL LEUCOCYTE COUNT (TLC)**: Elevated at 20,600 /uL (Reference Range: 4000-11000 /uL).
-   **NEUTROPHIL**: Elevated at 79 % (Reference Range: 40-75 %).
-   **LYMPHOCYTE**: Decreased at 15 % (Reference Range: 20-45 %).

### Summary
The report shows an elevated Total Leucocyte Count (TLC) of 20,600 /uL, exceeding the upper limit of the reference range (4000-11000 /uL). This is accompanied by an elevated Neutrophil percentage of 79% (reference range 40-75%) and a decreased Lymphocyte percentage of 15% (reference range 20-45%). All other blood parameters listed, including Haemoglobin, Platelet Count, RBC Count, PCV/Haematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Eosinophil, Monocyte, and Basophil percentages, are within their respective reference ranges. Data for URINE RM is not available.

### Clinical Notes
-   Total Leucocyte Count is above the upper limit of the reference range.
-   Neutrophil percentage is above the upper limit of the reference range.
-   Lymphocyte percentage is below the lower limit of the reference range.
-   All other reported blood parameters are within their specified reference ranges.
-   URINE RM test results are not provided in the table.
