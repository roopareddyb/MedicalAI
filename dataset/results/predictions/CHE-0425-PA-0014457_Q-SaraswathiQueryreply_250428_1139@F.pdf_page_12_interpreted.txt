### Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is slightly low at 82.8 fL (Reference Range: 83-101 fL).
- Total WBC Count is elevated at 14.63 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 4-11 10^3/uL).
- Neutrophil percentage is high at 83.6 % (Reference Range: 40-75 %).
- Lymphocyte percentage is low at 11.4 % (Reference Range: 20-40 %).
- Eosinophil percentage is low at 0.0 % (Reference Range: 1-6 %).
- Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is high at 12.23 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 2-7 10^3/uL).
- Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) is low at 0.00 10^3/uL (Reference Range: 0.02-0.5 10^3/uL).

### Summary
The complete blood count indicates an elevated total white blood cell count (14.63 10^3/uL), primarily due to an increased neutrophil percentage (83.6%) and absolute neutrophil count (12.23 10^3/uL). Concurrently, lymphocyte percentage (11.4%) and eosinophil percentage (0.0%) are decreased, with the absolute eosinophil count also being low (0.00 10^3/uL). The Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is slightly below the reference range at 82.8 fL. All other measured parameters, including haemoglobin, haematocrit, total RBC count, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV, monocyte percentage, basophil percentage, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute monocyte count, absolute basophil count, and platelet count, are within their respective reference ranges.
