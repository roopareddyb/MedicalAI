### Key Findings
- Elevated BILIRUBIN (DIRECT) at 0.409 mg/dL (Reference Range: 0.0-0.40 mg/dL).
- Elevated S.G.O.T (AST) at 70 U/L (Reference Range: 14-36 U/L).
- Elevated G.G.T at 61 U/L (Reference Range: 12-43 U/L).
- Elevated GLOBULIN at 3.6 gm/dL (Reference Range: 2.5-3.5 gm/dL).
- Decreased A/G RATIO at 1.14 (Reference Range: 1.5-2.5).
- Decreased HAEMOGLOBIN at 10.3 g/dL (Reference Range: 12.0-15.0 g/dL).
- Decreased PACKED CELL VOLUME (PCV) at 33.6% (Reference Range: 36-46%).
- Decreased R.B.C. Count at 3.33 x10^12/L (Reference Range: 3.8-4.8 x10^12/L).

### Summary
The laboratory results indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, specifically elevations in direct bilirubin, AST, and GGT. The protein profile shows an elevated globulin level and a reduced albumin/globulin ratio. Additionally, the complete blood count reveals findings consistent with anemia, including decreased hemoglobin, packed cell volume, and red blood cell count.

### Clinical Notes
- **Liver Function:** The elevated direct bilirubin, S.G.O.T (AST), and G.G.T suggest potential hepatobiliary dysfunction. S.G.P.T (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase are within their respective reference ranges.
- **Protein Profile:** The increased globulin level and decreased A/G ratio may indicate an inflammatory response or other conditions affecting protein metabolism.
- **Hematology:** The low Haemoglobin, PCV, and R.B.C. Count are indicative of anemia. The MCV (100.9 fL) and MCH (30.9 pg) are within their reference ranges, suggesting a normocytic, normochromic picture for the anemia.
