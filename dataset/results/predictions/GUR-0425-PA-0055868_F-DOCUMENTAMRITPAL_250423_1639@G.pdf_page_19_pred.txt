### Key Findings
- **Haemo:** Low at 11.5 L (Reference Range: 4.5-6.5)
- **PCV:** Low at 35.8 L % (Reference Range: 36-52)
- **MCH:** Low at 26.6 L pgms (Reference Range: 27.0-32.0)
- **Total WBC count:** High at 17100 H /cmm (Reference Range: 4000-10000)
- **Neutrophil:** High at 78.0 H % (Reference Range: 40-70)

### Summary
The laboratory report indicates several abnormalities. Red blood cell parameters show low Haemo (11.5 L), low PCV (35.8 L %), and low MCH (26.6 L pgms). White blood cell parameters show an elevated Total WBC count (17100 H /cmm) and an elevated Neutrophil percentage (78.0 H %). All other tested parameters, including Blood Sugar Random, MCV, MCHC, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Platelet Count, Serum Sodium, Calcium Ionized, Serum Potassium, Serum Chlorides, and Blood Urea, are within their respective reference ranges.

### Clinical Notes
Observations from the lab results include indications of potential anemia (low Haemo, PCV, and MCH) and an inflammatory or infectious process (elevated Total WBC count and Neutrophils). All other metabolic and electrolyte parameters, including blood sugar, kidney function (Blood Urea), and key electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chlorides, Ionized Calcium), are within normal limits.
