### Key Findings
-   **RBC Count**: 4.23 mil./cmm, which is below the reference range of 4.5-6.5 mil./cmm.
-   All other red blood cell parameters, including Hemoglobin (12.6 gm/dL), Haematocrit (38.6%), MCV (91.25 fL), MCH (29.79 pg), MCHC (32.64 gm/dL), RDW-CV (12.6%), RDW-SD (46.5 fL), and RBC Morphology (Normocytic Normochromic), are within their respective reference ranges or described as normal.
-   Total WBC Count (10900 /uL) and differential counts (Neutrophil 55%, Lymphocytes 40%, Eosinophil 02%, Monocytes 03%, Basophils 00%) are within normal limits, as is WBC Morphology (Within Normal Limits).
-   Platelet Count (361000 /cmm.), MPV (9.1 fL), PDW (14.9 fL), PCT (0.33%), and Platelet morphology (Adequate on smear) are within normal limits.

### Summary
The complete blood count (CBC) results primarily show a slightly decreased Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count. However, Hemoglobin and Haematocrit levels, along with other red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV, RDW-SD) and morphology, are within normal limits. White blood cell count and differential, as well as platelet count and morphology, are also within their respective normal ranges.

### Clinical Notes
The isolated finding of a low RBC count, while Hemoglobin and Haematocrit remain within normal limits and RBC morphology is Normocytic Normochromic, suggests a mild reduction in the number of red blood cells without indicating a significant anemia based on hemoglobin concentration or red cell size/color. This finding should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation.
