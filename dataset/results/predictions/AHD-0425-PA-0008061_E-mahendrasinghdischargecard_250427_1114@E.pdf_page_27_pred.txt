### Key Findings
- Hemoglobin is low (12.1 gm/dL).
- Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH) is low (24.7 pg).
- Mean Cell Hb Conc (MCHC) is low (28.5 %).
- Total WBC Count is high (13600 cells/cumm).
- Absolute Neutrophils Count is high (8976 /cumm).
- Absolute Lymphocytes Count is high (3264 /cumm).
- Absolute Eosinophils Count (AEC) is high (544 /cumm).

### Summary
The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, characterized by low Hemoglobin, Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH), and Mean Cell Hb Concentration (MCHC). Additionally, there is evidence of leukocytosis, with elevated Total White Blood Cell (WBC) count, Absolute Neutrophil Count, Absolute Lymphocyte Count, and Absolute Eosinophil Count. The Platelet Count is 502000 cells/cumm, but its clinical significance cannot be assessed without a provided reference range.
