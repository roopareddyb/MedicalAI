### Key Findings
- Hemoglobin is low at 11.80 gm/dL (Reference Range: 13.0-17.0).
- Haemotocrit is low at 35.90 % (Reference Range: 40-50).
- Platelets are low at 0.85 lacs/cumm (Reference Range: 1.5-4.5).
- Neutrophils percentage is high at 83.00 % (Reference Range: 40-75).
- Lymphocytes percentage is low at 11.20 % (Reference Range: 20-40).
- Lymphocytes absolute count is low at 0.82 x1000/cumm (Reference Range: 1-3).
- Eosinophils percentage is low at 0.70 % (Reference Range: 1-6).
- Basophils percentage is low at 0.10 % (Reference Range: 1-2).
- Basophils absolute count is low at 0.01 x1000/cumm (Reference Range: 0.02-0.1).

### Summary
The blood report indicates several deviations from the reference ranges. There is evidence of anemia, characterized by low Hemoglobin and Haemotocrit levels. The platelet count is significantly decreased. The white blood cell differential shows a high percentage of Neutrophils and low percentages of Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, and Basophils. The absolute counts for Lymphocytes and Basophils are also low. Total Leucocytes count, Erythrocytes count, Monocytes percentage and absolute count, Neutrophils absolute count, Eosinophils absolute count, and Mean Platelet Volume are within their respective reference ranges.

### Clinical Notes
This interpretation is based exclusively on the provided laboratory results. The observed abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and basopenia. These findings warrant clinical correlation with the patient's medical history, physical examination, and other diagnostic information for a comprehensive medical assessment.
