### Interpretation
### Key Findings
-   **HAEMOGLOBIN (Hb)**: 13.4 g/dL (Reference Range: 13.5-18.0 g/dL) - Low
-   **TOTAL LEUCOCYTE COUNT (TLC)**: 20,400 /uL (Reference Range: 4000-11000 /uL) - High
-   **NEUTROPHIL**: 77 % (Reference Range: 40-75 %) - High
-   **LYMPHOCYTE**: 18 % (Reference Range: 20-45 %) - Low
-   **RBC COUNT**: 4.34 Millions/cmm (Reference Range: 4.5-5.5 Millions/cmm) - Low

### Summary
The laboratory report shows an elevated Total Leukocyte Count (TLC) of 20,400 /uL, which is above the reference range. This is accompanied by an increased Neutrophil percentage of 77% and a decreased Lymphocyte percentage of 18%. Additionally, the HAEMOGLOBIN (Hb) is slightly low at 13.4 g/dL, and the RBC COUNT is also slightly low at 4.34 Millions/cmm. All other tested parameters, including Eosinophil, Monocyte, Basophil, Platelet Count, PC.V/HAEMATOCRIT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC, are within their respective reference ranges.

### Clinical Notes
Based solely on the provided laboratory results:
-   The patient exhibits leukocytosis, characterized by a significantly elevated Total Leukocyte Count (TLC).
-   The differential count indicates neutrophilia and lymphopenia, contributing to the overall leukocytosis.
-   There is evidence of mild anemia, suggested by HAEMOGLOBIN (Hb) and RBC COUNT values slightly below the lower limit of the reference range.
-   Other parameters, including Platelet Count, Eosinophil, Monocyte, Basophil, PC.V/HAEMATOCRIT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC, are within normal limits.
-   No other abnormalities are noted in the provided table.
